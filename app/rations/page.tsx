	          At the onset of the Second World War, the British government began preparing for the likelihood of total war, or the absolute mobilization of the nation’s resources to the war effort leaving no member of society unaffected. At this time, Britain was an importer, not an exporter, of food, and thus the inability to perform regular trade caused by the war would be even more difficult on the British people. The government began planning for rationing resources as early as 1936 and had already begun printing ration books long before their use became necessary in 1939 with the rationing of petrol. Food which was regularly imported or had low supplies in England quickly began to become rationed in the years following, and by 1942 most food products were rationed, with the exception of several readily available products. Other products which were not readily available also became rationed, such as the soap and clothing. Each person obtained a ration card with a certain number of coupons which could be used to purchase rationed goods, and no rationed item could be bought or sold without these coupons, and these goods were often sold illegally and under the table despite the ration cards. Further, each person was assigned a butcher and greengrocer, frustrating the free market and ensuring instead that stores could more safely estimate what they would have to supply each week, reducing the waste of rationed products. As textiles were reserved for military use, clothing was rationed heavily; coupons were only issued every 6 months, with exceptions for young children who need new clothes more frequently, and additionally the cloths themselves were heavily taxed, meaning on top of limited purchasing capacity they were more expensive to purchase. These rations also had a greater effect on urban communities, as though the rations ensured food was plenty for everyone, many could not afford to purchase the food which they had coupons for. On the contrary, anyone who raised their own animals or produce had access to additional food on top of what was rationed (although the rules about this were strict). This rationing continued long after the war had ended as the desolated Europe took time to rebound and restore production.

	          The girls of slender means are poor, urban, young women dealing with all of these rations. Keep note when reading of how they struggle to deal with the limited access to clothing, beauty supplies, food, and other products while all working with tight budgets. Jane justifies that she needs to eat more calories for her brain work while the other girls avoid eating certain things which might cause them to gain weight, and certain characters find access to certain goods on the black market. The girls find an interesting and rather unconventional use for soap, which they now cannot use to keep clean, to fit out onto the rooftop, and a certain dress becomes something of an icon for the girls due to how special it is, and how unobtainable these things become during the wartime.
